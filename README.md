Actionable Conclusion: Successful movies tend to perform well on social media platforms. This indicates that social media metrics 
can be a good predictor of a movie’s success. Leveraging social media campaigns to boost YouTube views and likes can be an effective strategy to enhance box office performance.

YouTube Dislikes:

Allocate more resources to marketing and promotions, especially on YouTube, to drive views and likes, which are positively correlated with box office success.
